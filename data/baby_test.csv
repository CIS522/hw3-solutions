0,0,Haven't played it since the beta but the game was mediocre at best when I played it.,"Well... How is it? I can't bring myself to download another let down F2PFPS. I don't wanna buy your cheap armor that makes me 1% harder to kill, and i shouldn't have to spend $30 to keep one gun."
1,0,Good time for front companies to get into the VPN business.,"Time to get a VPN lads. None of you are going to move, but you can get a VPN for about a fiver a month, and encrypt a lot of what you do online. Technology is the solution here."
2,1,"Sorry, I missed the part where they denied anyone service.","You can make that argument for any kind of discrimination. Why shouldn't individual businesses be able to say ""No dogs or Jews allowed"" or require minorities to use a separate entrance and facilities? They can just go someplace else, right? The problem is that some people end up having a lot less freedom. What if the only gas station in 100 miles won't serve you? That means you can't live there. What if most, or all, businesses in an area discriminate against you? That means you can't live there. And being able to charge more to discriminated classes can accomplish the same thing. You can effectively price people out of a given market. This ripples out throughout the economy. Suddenly, employees of a discriminated class are less valuable, so they get hired and promoted less, paid less. They can't travel for business through certain areas, they can't do business with certain companies. Suddenly, discriminated people have limited freedom of movement, because they can't be sure that businesses in a new area (such as a travel destination) will serve them. A business might even serve them today, and not tomorrow. Businesses in some areas could basically compete for bigot dollars by going out of their way to discriminate. The comparative freedom gained by allowing businesses to discriminate is far outpaced by the liberty lost by those who will be discriminated against, in my opinion. These laws were passed for a reason, and we don't need to give those rights away by failing to be vigilant. If the line isn't ""no discrimination in business based on color/creed/gender/etc"", then where do we draw the line, legally speaking?"
3,0,Exactly the same for me!,"Weirdly, it was the little specks of 3D dust and floating debris that I remember most!"
4,1,Why did the dems leave us vulnerable?,"Surely no one will defend the Russians *potentially* having the possibility of shutting down our electrical services? Surely, your partisan hatred for the Democrats, DNC, Clinton, etc, THIS would make you pause at least. Right? RIGHT?!"
5,0,"Nah, that's shit.",... said Ripley to the android Bishop.
